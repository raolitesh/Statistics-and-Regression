# Introduction
The World Happiness Report ranks countries based on data from an ordinal survey that measures factors such as generosity, perceived freedom, trust in government/perception of corruption, health/life expectancy, Economy GDP per capita, and family/Social Support, as well as a happiness score from respondents. This information can be used to identify potential factors that influence happiness and to compare forms of government (autocracy, democracy, oligarchy) and socio-legal factors (constitutional limits on government power, totalitarianism, parliamentary limits on power). This data may be helpful for multinational organizations looking to invest in countries with stable economies, governments, and labor markets. The happiness report can be found on Kaggle.com.

# Data
